# inital implementation of the project


----
I created a utils module that packages functions and classes for the project.

See the [utils_usage_examples.ipynb](https://github.com/DarienNouri/Trading-Strategy-Prjoect/blob/c6327f94ccef0929b11cef79f4a6d02e51100c98/examples/utils_usage_examples.ipynb) notebook for usage examples.

 This includes:

- data_downloader.py
incldues DataUtils class to download stock data using yfinance

- stock_visualizer.py
has some functions for visualizing statistical tests related to time series and financial data, some for preprocessing and some general

- analyser.py
Bulk of the utils. Inlcudes many functions for time series and financial data analysis. Raning from preprocessing to signal generation.

Note: I also included some resources, including articles book and python libs, I came across that may be useful for the project.
